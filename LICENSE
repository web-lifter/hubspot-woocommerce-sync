 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users. The Free Software Foundation uses the
 GNU General Public License for most of its software, and this license
 applies to any other work released under this framework by its authors.
 You can apply it to your programs as well.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
 Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
 freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
 you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
 that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
 programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
 or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 To prevent patents from restricting development and use of free software,
 the GPL ensures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and
 modification follow.

                     TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  "Modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  "Convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

 If you develop a new program and want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software, which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

 To do so, attach the following notice to the program. It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty, and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
